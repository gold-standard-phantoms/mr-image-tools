  abstract  = {ASLDRO is digital reference object software for Arterial Spin Labelling. Here we present the development and demonstration of the DRO software, and its use in a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of the single-subtraction equation for ASL perfusion quantification.The DRO software was written in python, and can generate synthetic ASL control, label and M0 data in ASL BIDS format. Pulsed and continuous labelling are supported, and patient motion and instrument noise are accurately simulated. It can be used both for testing and validation of image processing software, and for investigating ASL quantification models.},
