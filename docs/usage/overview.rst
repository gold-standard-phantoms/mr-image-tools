Overview
--------

MRImageTools was developed to address the need to test MR image processing pipelines.
A strong emphasis has been placed on ensuring traceability of the developed
code, in particular with respect to testing. The library uses a ‘pipe and filter’ architecture
with ‘filters’ performing data processing, which provides a common interface between processing
blocks.
